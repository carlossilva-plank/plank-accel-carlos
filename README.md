## LangGraph Workflow

![LangGraph Workflow Architecture](workflow.jpeg)

The application uses LangGraph to orchestrate a multi-agent system with parallel processing capabilities. The architecture follows a Router-Agents-Aggregator pattern:

### Agent Design
- **Router Agent**: Analyzes user input and determines which specialized agent(s) should handle the request
- **Specialized Agents**:
  - Weather Agent: Handles weather-related queries with real-time data
  - News Agent: Processes news-related requests with current events
  - General Agent: Manages general knowledge and conversation
- **Communication**: Agents operate independently and in parallel when multiple are selected

### Graph Structure
- **Nodes**:
  - Router Node: Entry point that analyzes and routes requests
  - Agent Nodes: Specialized processing units (Weather, News, General)
  - Aggregator Node: Combines multiple agent responses
- **Edges**:
  - START ‚Üí Router: Initial request analysis
  - Router ‚Üí Agent(s): Conditional routing based on content
  - Agent(s) ‚Üí Aggregator: Response collection
  - Aggregator ‚Üí END: Final response formation

### State Management
- **Graph State**:
  - input: User's message
  - decision: Selected agents for processing
  - outputs: Individual agent responses
  - combinedOutputs: Aggregated final response
- **Agent State**:
  - Every agent can read and access
  - Includes conversation history

### Integration Points
- **Frontend Communication**:
  - Next.js API routes for request handling
  - Real-time response streaming
  - WebSocket for continuous updates
- **External Connections**:
  - OpenAI API for LLM processing
  - Weather API for real-time weather data
  - News API for current events
- **Error Handling**:
  - Graceful degradation on agent failures
  - Fallback to general agent when specialized services fail
  - Request validation and sanitization
